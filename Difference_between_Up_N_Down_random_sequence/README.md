# Documentation

To see the complete documentation in **rst** format you can open the file `doc/source/README.rst`.

You can also build the documentation if you have sphinx installed.
Run `apt-get install python3-sphinx` to install sphinx.
Then go into `doc/` and run `make html`. This will create a folder `doc/build/`.
You can open the file `doc/build/html/index.html` to see the built documentation.
